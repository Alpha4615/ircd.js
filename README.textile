h3. About

I'm implementing rfc1459/rfc2812 in "Node":http://nodejs.org/.

The server will allow clients to connect, join channels, change topics; basic stuff.

Done:

* PING/PONG
* PRIVMSG
* MODE
* JOIN
* TOPIC
* NAMES
* LIST
* INVITE
* WHOWAS
* VERSION
* Connection garbage like MOTD
* Basic data validation
* Simple JSON config file
* Modes: o, p, s, t, n, m, i, l, b, v, k

Planned:

* More basic commands
* More tests (I only wrote basic tests to get started)
* Log files and logging options

After the event horizon:

* Passwords
* Server to server communication
* Stats command
